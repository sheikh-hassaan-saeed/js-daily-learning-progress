# JavaScript Daily Learning Progress

This repository documents my **daily learning** and practice in **vanilla JavaScript** through:
- Core topics (variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM, events)
- Real mini-projects (weather app, employee tracker, calculators, etc.)

## 💼 Why This Matters

As someone preparing for frontend roles, I’m using this repo to:
- Strengthen the **core logic** behind all frontend development
- Build **project-ready problem-solving skills**
- Gain the confidence to debug, refactor, and optimize code
- Treat JavaScript not as a syntax — but as a way of thinking

---

## 🌱 What I'm Trying to Achieve

- Build a rock-solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals  
- Treat every small concept like a “brick” in my frontend foundation  
- Learn by doing — not just watching videos or copying code  
- Turn this into a visible track record of growth
